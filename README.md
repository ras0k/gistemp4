# GISTEMP4.0 Data Processing Pipeline

A Python workflow for processing NASA's global temperature data using GISTEMP v4. 

This pipeline automates data download, preprocessing, and analysis while offering performance optimizations.

## Features

-   Automated download of NASA's official GISTEMP v4 source package
    
-   Enhanced performance by using PyPy
    
-   Compatibility management for legacy scientific code
    
-   Designed for execution on cloud notebook environments (Colab) 
    
## Usage

### Google Colab

1.  Open the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ras0k/gistemp4/blob/main/gistemp4.ipynb)
    
2.  Run all cells sequentially (**"Runtime > Run all"** or **Ctrl+F9**)

    

## Results



The results are printed out and can also be found in the file:
