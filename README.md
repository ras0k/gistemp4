# GISTEMP4.0 Data Processing Pipeline

A Python workflow for processing NASA's GISTEMP v4 global temperature data using original Fortran scientific routines. This pipeline automates data download, preprocessing, and analysis while offering performance optimizations.

## Features

-   Automated download of NASA's official GISTEMP v4 source package
    
-   Compatibility management for legacy scientific code
    
-   Results packaging in standardized formats
    
-   Designed for both local execution and cloud notebook environments
    
## Usage

### Google Colab

1.  Open the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ras0k/gistemp4/blob/main/gistemp4.ipynb)
    
2.  Run all cells sequentially

## To-Do List

### High Priority
    
-   âš¡ Implement PyPy3 runtime for faster operations
    
-   ðŸ”§ Resolve numpy compatibility issues (temporary fix using v1.23.1)

    

## Results

Processed outputs are packaged in `results.zip` containing:

-   Global temperature anomaly calculations
    
-   Intermediate processing artifacts
    
-   Diagnostic logs and metadata
